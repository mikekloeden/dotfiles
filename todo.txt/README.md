# todo.txt

This is for [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com). It's a super-simple command-line
interface to your todo.txt.

My todo.txt is located in a `todo` folder inside my Dropbox. Feel free to configure your `todo.symlink/config` file.

I also put the number of todo tasks tagged as `+next` in my ZSH right-hand
prompt, which helps me focus on what needs to be done next. You can use the `n` command to show a list of those tasks too. Pretty cool.
